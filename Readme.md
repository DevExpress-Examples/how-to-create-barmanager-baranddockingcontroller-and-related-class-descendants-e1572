# How to create BarManager, BarAndDockingController and related class descendants


<p>These examples demonstrate how to create descendants of the BarManager, and other classes that are needed for its infrastructure. Here, the following custom classes are implemented:<br />
- MyBarManager<br />
- MySkinBarManagerPaintStyle<br />
- MyBarAndDockingController<br />
- MyBarButtonItem</p><p>They can be used at design time as well. To demonstrate this, here is a form where bars and popup menus use our custom bar manager.</p><p><strong>See Also:</strong><br />
